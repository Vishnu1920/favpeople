    Virat Kohli's journey from a young Delhi boy to one of the most celebrated cricketers in history is marked by struggles, resilience, and immense success across different phases of his life.

1. Early Life and Struggles (1988 - 2007):

Born in Delhi on November 5, 1988, Kohli showed a passion for cricket at an early age. His father, Prem Kohli, recognized his potential and enrolled him at the West Delhi Cricket Academy. Despite coming from a middle-class family, Kohli's father supported his dream, even sacrificing his own career to invest in Kohli's training. However, tragedy struck in 2006 when his father passed away suddenly. Kohli, just 18, was deeply affected but famously showed his dedication by playing a crucial domestic match for Delhi the very next day. This early loss and his unwavering commitment shaped his resilience and determination.





2. Breakthrough and Rise (2008 - 2012):

In 2008, Kohli captained India's Under-19 team to victory in the ICC Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. Soon after, he earned a spot in the senior Indian team, debuting in an ODI match against Sri Lanka. His journey in the Indian Premier League (IPL) began the same year with the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), providing him a platform to showcase his aggressive batting style. Over the next few years, Kohli solidified his place in the ODI team with consistent performances, especially under pressure. His early struggles with form, fitness, and maturity began to fade as he developed a disciplined approach, and by 2012, he had established himself as a reliable top-order batsman for India.





3. Becoming a Superstar (2013 - 2016):

Kohli's career reached new heights in this phase. Known for his chasing abilities, he began to regularly guide India to victories, especially in limited-overs formats. In 2013, he was appointed vice-captain, and in 2014, he took over as Test captain from MS Dhoni, marking the beginning of his leadership role. His commitment to fitness and discipline set new standards within the team. Under Kohli, India became a highly competitive team worldwide, especially in Test cricket, and he led from the front with his aggressive playing style and impeccable batting records. By this time, he was being compared with cricketing legends for his skill, work ethic, and fierce desire to win.

4. Captaincy and Legacy Building (2017 - 2021):

Kohli's captaincy tenure was defined by both success and pressure. He became India's full-time captain in all formats by 2017. His leadership led India to numerous historic series wins abroad, including victories in Australia and a dominant Test run. Kohli's intense focus on fitness and discipline influenced the entire squad, leading to India being recognized as one of the fittest teams globally. Despite his success, Kohli faced criticism for his intense leadership style and India's lack of ICC trophies during his tenure. Yet, his consistency with the bat continued, making him the fastest to reach multiple ODI milestones. This phase also saw Kohli mature as a cricketer and a public figure, as he openly spoke about mental health and the pressures of international cricket.

5. Transition and Mentorship (2022 - Present):

After a period of intense pressure and media scrutiny, Kohli stepped down from T20 captaincy in late 2021 and subsequently relinquished his leadership in all formats by early 2022. This phase marks a turning point in Kohliâ€™s career, as he shifted focus back to his batting while supporting the new generation of Indian cricketers. After a brief struggle with form, Kohli returned to the field with renewed focus, notably scoring his 71st century after a long gap. Embracing his role as a mentor, Kohli remains a core member of the team, using his experience to guide younger players while continuing to set records in both international cricket and the IPL.

Throughout his career, Kohli has been a beacon of determination, known for transforming his setbacks into successes. His journey from a young Delhi cricketer to a global superstar highlights his resilience, unyielding work ethic, and commitment to excellence. His contributions have left an indelible mark on Indian cricket, inspiring millions worldwide.
